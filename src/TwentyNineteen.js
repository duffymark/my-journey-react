            <p>- while searching for a new direction to take my career, I thought about how I could use my passions of building, and creating to do something more fulfilling. I decided to delve into programming during my spare time.</p>
            
            <p>- didn't know where to begin! My first line of code was Ruby on Rails using <a class="bookLink" href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">Chris Pine's Learn to Program.</a></p>   
            
            <p>- during my daughter's naps I would use free learning resources such as Codeacademy and Udemy in order to learn the fundamentas - HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
