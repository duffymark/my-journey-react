            <p>- my wife received a new job offer in Nova Scotia. I continued caring for our 3 year old until she started school, all the while keeping up with my online learning.</p>
            
            <p>- our daughter starts pre-kindergarten. I make the decision to go back to college to complete Juno College's Web developer course.</p>
            
            <p>- COVID hits, meaning my daughter's school will be closed indefinitely. I delay my next College course - JavaScript.</p>
